##  Task: Check Whether a Person is Eligible to Vote

### ✔ Complete Program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
        printf("You are eligible to vote.");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

###  Explanation:

* The condition `age >= 18` checks whether the person is **18 or older**.
* Since `age = 20`, the condition is **true**.
* Therefore, the program prints:

```
You are eligible to vote.
```
