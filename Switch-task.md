Here are **practice tasks using `switch` in C** — starting from basic to a bit more advanced.

---

## 🧩 Task 1 — Day of Week

Write a C program that uses a `switch` statement to display the day name based on a number (1–7).

**Requirement**

* 1 → Monday
* 2 → Tuesday
* …
* 7 → Sunday
* Any other number → Invalid day

---

## 🧩 Task 2 — Simple Calculator

Create a program that:

* Declares two integers `a = 10`, `b = 5`
* Declares a char variable `op = '+'`
* Uses `switch(op)` to perform:

  * `+` Addition
  * `-` Subtraction
  * `*` Multiplication
  * `/` Division
  * default → Invalid operator

---

## 🧩 Task 3 — Vowel Checker

Create a program that:

* Declares `char ch = 'e';`
* Uses `switch` to check whether the character is:

  * Vowel (a, e, i, o, u — both cases)
  * Consonant

---

## 🧩 Task 4 — Menu Driven Program

Display a menu:

```
1. Area of Square
2. Area of Circle
3. Area of Rectangle
```

* Declare `int choice = 2;`
* Use `switch(choice)` to calculate the area using fixed values:

  * square side = 4
  * circle radius = 3
  * rectangle length = 5, width = 2

---

## 🧩 Task 5 — Grade Message

Declare `char grade = 'B';`
Use `switch` to print message:

| Grade | Output            |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| A     | Excellent         |
| B     | Good              |
| C     | Average           |
| D     | Needs Improvement |
| F     | Fail              |

---

✅ **Bonus Challenge:**
Create a program using **nested switch** to:

* Choose language (1 = English, 2 = Hindi)
* Then choose greeting (1 = Hello, 2 = Welcome)
