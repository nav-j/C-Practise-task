## **Answer Key**

### **Section A: Short Answer Questions**

1. **Purpose of `#include <stdio.h>`**
   It allows the use of standard input and output functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.

2. **Function of `printf()`**
   It is used to display output (text or values) on the screen.

3. **Role of `return 0;` in `main()`**
   It ends the execution of the `main()` function and returns control to the operating system.

4. **Purpose of `\n`**
   It moves the cursor to a new line (creates a line break).

5. **Use of semicolon (`;`)**
   It marks the end of a statement in C.

### **Section B: Long Answer Questions**

1. **Structure of a Basic C Program**

   A basic C program consists of:

   * **Header files**: `#include <stdio.h>` for input/output functions
   * **main() function**: Entry point of the program
   * **Statements**: Instructions inside `main()`
   * **return 0;**: Ends the program

   **Example:**

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello World!");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Purpose of the `main()` Function**

   The `main()` function is the starting point of program execution.
   All statements inside `main()` are executed when the program runs.
   Without `main()`, a C program cannot run.

3. **`printf()` and Escape Characters**

   The `printf()` function prints output on the screen.
   Escape characters like `\n` are used to format output.

   **Example:**

   ```c
   printf("Hello World!\nI am learning C.");
   ```

4. **White Spaces and Execution Order**

   White spaces include spaces, tabs, and blank lines.
   C ignores extra white spaces.
   Statements are executed one by one in the order they are written.

5. **Program to Print Text on Multiple Lines**

   **Program:**

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("Hello World!\nI am learning C.");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```
   Hello World!
   I am learning C.
   ```
