## **Answer Key: Assignment Operators in C**

---

### **Task 1: Simple Assignment (`=`)**

```c
int x = 10;
x = x + 5;
```

Calculation:

```
10 + 5 = 15
```

 **Output:**

```
15
```

---

### **Task 2: Add Assignment (`+=`)**

```c
int a = 8;
a += 12;
```

Equivalent to:

```
a = a + 12 = 8 + 12 = 20
```

 **Output:**

```
20
```

---

### **Task 3: Subtract Assignment (`-=`)**

```c
int x = 20;
x -= 7;
```

Equivalent to:

```
x = 20 - 7 = 13
```

 **Output:**

```
13
```

---

### **Task 4: Multiply Assignment (`*=`)**

```c
int p = 6;
p *= 4;
```

Equivalent to:

```
p = 6 × 4 = 24
```

 **Output:**

```
24
```

---

### **Task 5: Divide Assignment (`/=`)**

```c
int y = 25;
y /= 4;
```

Integer division:

```
25 ÷ 4 = 6
```

 **Output:**

```
6
```

---

### **Task 6: Modulus Assignment (`%=`)**

```c
int x = 29;
x %= 6;
```

Calculation:

```
29 % 6 = 5
```

 **Output:**

```
5
```

---

### **Task 7: Mixed Assignment Operators**

```c
int a = 5;
a += 3;   // 8
a *= 2;   // 16
a -= 4;   // 12
```

 **Output:**

```
12
```

---

### **Task 8: Bitwise Assignment**

```c
int x = 12;
x <<= 2;
```

Left shift:

```
12 × 2² = 48
```

 **Output:**

```
48
```
